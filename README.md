**Sky Cipher**  is a predictive AI simulation designed to answer one critical question: Will the drone survive the jam? By merging Deep Reinforcement Learning with high-fidelity *PyBullet physics*, this platform simulates severe **Electronic Warfare (EW)** and GPS-denial scenarios. It provides a purely predictive framework to evaluate mission success and evasive strategies when the skies are actively contested.

## 🛡️ The Mission: Defeating the Jamming
In modern conflict zones, drones face constant threats from GPS denial and communication interference. **Sky Cipher** provides a predictive framework to:
* **Simulate Hostile Environments:** Model complex signal interference patterns.
* **Predict Mission Success:** Use AI to forecast whether a drone will reach its target or fail due to jamming.
* **Adaptive Behavior:** Train RL agents to develop "evasive" maneuvers or alternative navigation logic when primary signals are lost.

## 🧠 Technical Core
* **Physics Engine:** Powered by `PyBullet` for realistic 6-DOF drone dynamics.
* **AI Architecture:** Deep Reinforcement Learning agents trained to navigate through high-interference zones.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Includes the `SkyCipher Dataset`, a comprehensive collection of flight frames categorized by mission outcomes (Evading, Crash, Success).
* **Predictive Dashboard:** A `Streamlit` interface for real-time visualization of mission success probabilities.
## ⚙️ Enterprise Integration & Threat Response
To bridge the gap between AI prediction and real-world operations, **Sky Cipher** utilizes an **n8n** automation pipeline. This workflow acts as a tactical router, instantly processing the AI's predictive outcomes and triggering automated alerts (e.g., when a drone enters a severe jamming zone or faces an imminent crash).
